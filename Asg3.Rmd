a.  Worked out on separate paper. 




b. Yes, the data do appear to follow an exponential distribution of $\beta=95$ because in an exponential probability distribution $\mu=\beta$ and the $\mu$ is 95 in this case.

```{r}
leadcopp = read.csv("LEADCOPP.csv")
head(leadcopp)
```
## A 

```{r}
t.test(leadcopp$Ã¯..LEAD,conf.level= 0.99)
```

## B 

```{r}
t.test(leadcopp$COPPER, conf.level = 0.99)
```

## C 

The confidence interval for lead in the specimens of water is (-1.14, 6.919) meaning there is confidence that lead levels fall between these two numbers in the sampled water. 

There is confidence that the copper levels in the sampled water lies in the interval (0.1518, 0.66472). 

## D 

99% confidence means that there is a 99% likelihood that the mean of the copper and lead levels fall within the intervals from c. 

# Q 15 

Find 95% confidence level for the mean difference between the day-long clear-sky solar irradiation levels. This is a paired sample. 

```{r}
solarad = read.csv("SOLARAD.csv")

with(solarad, t.test(IOWA, STJOS, paired = TRUE, conf= 0.95))
```



# Q 16 

## A 

```{r}
diazinon = read.csv("DIAZINON.csv")

with(diazinon, t.test(DAY, NIGHT, paired = TRUE, conf= 0.95))
```

The 90% confidence interval that describes how day and night differ is (-63.48,-14.33440)

## B 

Some assumptions that have to be made for part a to be valid is that the samples are independent and they are a normal distribution. 

## C 

The mean difference is -38.90 meaning there is always some difference between day and night.
